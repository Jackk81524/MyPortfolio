Going back to elementary school, we'd eagerly pick the winners of playoff games and track the results on coloring paper. As we got older, the tradition continuedâ€”though it transitioned to a clunky Excel spreadsheet! It wasn't the smoothest, but it kept the fun alive. This year, I decided to combine my software development skills with that tradition and create an easy-to-use website that allows us to submit our picks and automatically track the standings, all while keeping the spirit of friendly competition alive.", "This website is built with a React frontend that provides a dynamic, responsive user experience, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring efficient handling of requests and seamless integration with the frontend.
