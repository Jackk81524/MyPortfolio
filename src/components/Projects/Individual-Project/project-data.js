      description: "This project is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills as a software developer and provide a dynamic platform to highlight my projects, experience, and achievements. This is actually the webpage you are on right now! This project was not only a demonstration of my technical abilities but also a valuable learning experience, as it was my first time working with React. The site demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development technologies, including responsive design, state management, and interactive components. It serves as both a professional portfolio and a practical example of my abilities to create clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications.",

      description: "Sweat Social is an innovative fitness application designed to help users effortlessly track their workouts, while leveraging social interaction to keep them motivated. Created as a Senior Design project at Purdue University, this app is built using Swift and SwiftUI to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. Sweat Social enables users to log their workouts and track progress over time, while incorporating a gamified achievement system that rewards individuals for reaching fitness milestones. What sets Sweat Social apart is its emphasis on community—users can share workout data with friends, fostering an environment that encourages accountability, engagement, and motivation through social pressure. Whether someone is a fitness enthusiast or just starting their journey, Sweat Social is designed to help users stay motivated and make their fitness routine more enjoyable. Due to the constraints of the Senior Design course, I was unable to deploy it to the App Store, but I’ve created an overview video, which you can watch by following the link below!",
